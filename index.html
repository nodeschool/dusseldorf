  Have you always wanted to learn Node.js, but never gotten the chance to?
  Do you live in or around the North Rhine-Westphalian capital Düsseldorf?
  Then join us for our regular NodeSchool Düsseldorf meetup!
</p>
<h3 class="f3 fw3">Self-guided</h3>
<p class="f5 f4-ns mb5 lh-copy measure sans-serif">
  NodeSchool is no traditional meetup. Together, we work on solving
  "Workshoppers". These are self-guided tutorials that teach aspects of
  the Node.js ecosystem. They are open-source, which means that you can
  even continue to learn at home!
</p>
<h3 class="f3 fw3">Open for everyone</h3>
<p class="f5 f4-ns mb5 lh-copy measure sans-serif">
  We think it's important that everyone can attend, no matter if they
  haven't ever programmed in JavaScript or already have experience.
  Because of this, we offer two workshoppers at every meetup so that
  everyone can work on a topic they're interested in.
  We also have a
  <a href="https://github.com/nodeschool/dusseldorf/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>
  which we will enforce at our meetup.
