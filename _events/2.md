It's time for a new NodeSchool! This time we'll be primarily working on the
[git-it] and the [how-to-npm] workshoppers, but we'll also offer mentor support
for the two previous ones, [learnyounode] and [javascripting].

Also, by popular request, we'll be giving a talk about what Node.js is
and what it is used for!

We'll be meeting at InVision HQ in the Medienhafen.
